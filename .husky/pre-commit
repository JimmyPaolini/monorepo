# VS Code's SCM panel sets NO_COLOR=1, which conflicts with FORCE_COLOR set by Nx
# when it spawns task processes (both set simultaneously triggers a Node.js warning).
# Explicitly unset NO_COLOR and force FORCE_COLOR=1 so lint-staged detects color=true
# and passes FORCE_COLOR to child processes instead of NO_COLOR.
