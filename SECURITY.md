## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, use one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/JimmyPaolini/monorepo/security/advisories/new) through GitHub's private reporting feature.
2. **Email**: Contact the maintainer directly at the email address listed in the repository profile.

### What to Include

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- The affected project(s) within the monorepo (caelundas, lexico, lexico-components, infrastructure)
- Any suggested fixes, if available

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of the report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days, you will receive an initial assessment of the vulnerability
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched as quickly as possible; non-critical issues will be addressed in the next scheduled release

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure. After a fix is released, the vulnerability details may be published in a security advisory. Reporters will be credited unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
