# 📋 Context

CONTEXT="$ERROR
🚨 Git commit signing is required in this repository.Y

Action required:
1. Stop and do not create commits until signing is configured.
2. Confirm repository environment \"copilot\" has secrets \"GPG_PRIVATE_KEY\" and \"GPG_PASSPHRASE\".
3. Re-run workflow \".github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml\" so the GPG key is imported and signing is enabled.
4. Start a fresh cloud agent session after the workflow completes.
5. Re-run \"bash scripts/git/check-commit-signing-configuration.sh\".
6. If signatures still are not verified, add the matching public key to GitHub: Settings -> SSH and GPG keys."
