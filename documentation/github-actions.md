# GitHub Actions CI/CD

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline architecture for the monorepo.

## Overview

The monorepo uses 11 GitHub Actions workflows and 1 composite action, all located in `.github/`. Every workflow uses the shared [`setup-monorepo`](#composite-action-setup-monorepo) composite action for consistent environment setup and Nx caching.

## Composite Action: setup-monorepo

**Location:** `.github/actions/setup-monorepo/action.yml`

All workflows call this composite action after checkout. It provides:

|Step|Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|pnpm|pnpm/action-setup@v4|Package manager|
|Node.js|actions/setup-node@v4|JavaScript runtime from `.nvmrc`, with pnpm cache|
|Nx SHAs|nrwl/nx-set-shas@v4|Calculates `NX_BASE`/`NX_HEAD` for affected commands|
|Nx output style|env var|Sets `NX_DEFAULT_OUTPUT_STYLE=static`|
|Homebrew|Homebrew/actions/setup-homebrew|Package manager for system tools|
|gitleaks|brew install|Secret scanning tool|
|Nx cache|actions/cache@v4|Restores/saves `.nx/cache` keyed on lockfile + SHA|
|uv|astral-sh/setup-uv@v6|Python package manager with cache|
|Python dependencies|uv sync|Installs affirmations Python deps from pyproject.toml|
|Node.js dependencies|pnpm install --frozen-lockfile|Frozen lockfile install|

**Usage in workflows:**

```yaml
- name: 📥 Checkout Repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0

- name: 🕋 Setup Monorepo
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup-monorepo
```

## Workflow Architecture

### Concurrency Strategy

All workflows use concurrency groups keyed by `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true`. This ensures only one run per branch per workflow, canceling older runs when new commits are pushed.

### Affected Commands

Most workflows use `nx affected -t <target>` which only runs tasks on projects changed since the base branch. The `nrwl/nx-set-shas` action in `setup-monorepo` automatically determines the correct base SHA (`NX_BASE`) and head SHA (`NX_HEAD`) for comparison.

### Caching

- **pnpm cache:** Managed by `actions/setup-node` via pnpm lockfile hash
- **Nx cache:** Managed by `actions/cache` with SHA-based keys and restore fallbacks (`.nx/cache`)
- **uv cache:** Managed by `astral-sh/setup-uv` for Python dependencies

## Adding a New Workflow

1. Create `.github/workflows/<name>.yml`
2. Use the standard pattern:

   ```yaml
   name: <emoji> <Name>

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:

   concurrency:
     group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
     cancel-in-progress: true

   jobs:
     <job-name>:
       name: <emoji> <Job Name>
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
         - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-monorepo
         - run: npx nx affected -t <target> --parallel=3
   ```

3. Follow the emoji naming convention used by existing workflows
4. Use `nx affected` for project-specific tasks and `nx run monorepo:<target>` for workspace-level tasks
