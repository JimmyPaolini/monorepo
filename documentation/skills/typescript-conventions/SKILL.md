# TypeScript Conventions

All TypeScript projects in this monorepo use strict settings. This skill is the entry point and links to focused reference files so guidance stays organized and maintainable.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Writing or refactoring `.ts` or `.tsx` files
- Fixing TypeScript compile or lint errors
- Reviewing strict-mode type-safety issues
- Standardizing naming, import style, or control-flow patterns
- Writing strict typed tests (including `fs.readdirSync` Dirent mocks)

## References

- [Strict typing](./references/strict-typing.md)
: strict flags, explicit return types, `any` avoidance, `unknown`, promises, exhaustive switches.
- [Naming and imports](./references/naming-and-imports.md)
: identifier naming, abbreviation rules, type imports, NodeNext `.js` extensions.
- [Class and control flow](./references/class-and-control-flow.md)
: readonly properties, braces, early returns, object shorthand, template literals.
- [Error handling and tests](./references/errors-and-tests.md)
: catch typing, guard-first test narrowing, Node Dirent mock typing pattern.

- [Validate code](../validate-code/SKILL.md)

## Verification

After TypeScript changes:

```bash
pnpm exec nx run <project>:analyze-code --configuration=write
pnpm exec nx run <project>:analyze-code --configuration=check
```

## Notes

- Keep this `SKILL.md` concise and discovery-focused.
- Add detailed examples and larger workflows to files under `references/`.
- > ✅ **Best practice:** In NestJS class files such as `*.service.ts`, `*.command.ts`, `*.resolver.ts`, `*.dataloader.ts`, and `*.module.ts`, keep only imports and the class at top level. Move helper types and interfaces to `*.types.ts`, constants to `*.constants.ts`, and shared initialization logic into class members or dedicated modules.
- > ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not use top-level alias exports or type re-exports from NestJS class files. Import supporting symbols from their source `*.types.ts` or `*.constants.ts` file instead of re-exporting them through the class file.
