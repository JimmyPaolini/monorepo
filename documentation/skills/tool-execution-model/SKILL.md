# Tool Execution Model

This skill clarifies when to use Nx task execution (`nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) versus running tools directly.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when a request mentions:

- Running build, lint, test, typecheck, format, or code-analysis tasks
- Docker builds, kubectl, Helm, or Supabase CLI commands
- Questions about why Nx should or should not be used
- CI/CD guidance for task execution

## Nx Task Execution (Workspace Tasks)

Use Nx for tasks that operate on workspace source files:

```bash
# Build, lint, test, typecheck
nx run <project>:build
nx run <project>:lint
nx run <project>:test
nx run <project>:typecheck

# Multi-project
nx run-many --target=lint --all
nx affected --target=test --base=main
```

Why:

- Caching (local/remote)
- Dependency-aware task ordering
- Affected computation for CI
- Consistent task execution across projects

## Direct Tool Invocation (Infrastructure and External Systems)

Use direct tools for operations outside the workspace task graph:

```bash
# Docker
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t myapp .

# Kubernetes
kubectl get pods
helm upgrade --install myrelease ./chart

# Supabase CLI
supabase start
supabase db diff

# Package manager and Git
pnpm install
git commit -m "..."
```

These operate on external systems (container registry, cluster state, database containers, Git history) and cannot be cached by Nx.

## Nx Wrappers for Tooling

When an Nx target exists, prefer it for consistency:

```bash
nx run caelundas:docker-build
nx run lexico:supabase:start
```

These targets still invoke the underlying CLI, but centralize configuration.

## Decision Flow

```text
Does the task operate on workspace source files?
  ├─ Yes → Use Nx
  └─ No  → Use direct tool
```
