## Monorepo Quick Reference

**Nx monorepo (pnpm)** with strict TypeScript, React 19, and multiple applications.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Run tasks via Nx (always prefer this)
nx run <project>:build
nx run-many --target=lint --all
nx affected --target=test --base=main

# Install dependencies
pnpm add --filter <project> <package>
pnpm add -w <package>  # Workspace root

# Tools that run directly (not via Nx)
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t myapp .
kubectl get pods
helm upgrade --install myrelease ./chart
```

See [Tool Execution Model](documentation/development/tool-execution-model.md) for when to use Nx vs. direct tools.

## Skills

Specialized domain knowledge for working on specific systems or patterns:

<!-- agent-skills-table-of-contents start -->
- **[backup-code](.agents/skills/backup-code/SKILL.md)**: "Create a safety backup before potentially destructive actions. Use when running risky git commands (reset, rebase, clean, restore, checkout with overwrite, force push), applying large sweeping edits, mass refactors, broad search-and-replace, generator rewrites, or any operation that may be hard to undo. Produces a recoverable snapshot via backup branch, stash, or both, and verifies recovery commands."
- **[brainstorming](.agents/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md)**: "You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation."
- **[change-plan](.agents/skills/change-plan/SKILL.md)**: "Revise an existing implementation plan to incorporate scope changes, new requirements, or corrected assumptions. Use when asked to modify plan tasks, constraints, phases, or implementation approach."
- **[checkout-branch](.agents/skills/checkout-branch/SKILL.md)**: Create and validate Git branch names following this monorepo's Conventional Commits naming convention. Use this skill when creating branches, renaming branches, or when asked about branch naming rules and validation.

- **[resolve-conflicts](.agents/skills/resolve-conflicts/SKILL.md)**: Workflow to resolve Git merge conflicts cleanly. Use when asked to resolve conflicts, fix merge issues, merge a branch, or rebase with conflicts. This skill instructs the agent to analyze both branches to understand their distinct purposes before resolving conflicts to preserve the intent of both.
- **[restore-code](.agents/skills/restore-code/SKILL.md)**: "Restore code safely from backup artifacts created before risky changes. Use when undoing destructive operations, recovering from failed refactors or rebases, restoring deleted files, rolling back broad search-and-replace edits, or rehydrating work from backup branches and stashes. Supports preview-first recovery via backup branch, stash, or selective file restoration."
- **[seed-postgres](.agents/skills/seed-postgres/SKILL.md)**: "Use this skill to dump and restore local PostgreSQL databases, schemas, and tables (collections) using Nx targets and pg_dump/pg_restore. Use when asked to backup, dump, export, restore, import, or copy local database data."
- **[sign-commits](.agents/skills/sign-commits/SKILL.md)**: Re-sign unsigned commits on the current branch or pull request without changing code content by rewriting only from the first unsigned commit onward on a temporary branch. Use when asked to sign commits, add GPG signatures to an existing branch, satisfy signed-commit requirements, or make a PR show verified commits. Creates a backup branch first, runs the rebase non-interactively, verifies the rewritten final tree exactly matches the original branch tip, and stops immediately if any check, conflict, drift, or GPG step fails.
- **[spell-check](.agents/skills/spell-check/SKILL.md)**: Run and triage cspell in this monorepo. Use when spell-check fails in lint-staged, nx affected, or nx run-many, when cspell reports Unknown word entries, or when adding domain vocabulary to the correct dictionary under configuration/.cspell.

<!-- conformance-generators-table end -->

## Work Scope Discipline

- Focus on one project at a time when coding or refactoring.
- If a request spans multiple projects or scopes, complete the first project end-to-end before starting the next one.
- If the work is truly independent across projects, split it into separate subagents or separate passes so each agent stays project-scoped.
- Avoid mixing unrelated project changes in one context unless the task is explicitly orchestrating them.

## Code Quality & Validation

**Every coding agent MUST run the `validate-code` skill before declaring any implementation task complete.** This is non-negotiable.

```bash
# Auto-fix all format, lint, and unused-code issues
pnpm exec nx affected --target=analyze-code --configuration=write --base=main

# Verify no issues remain — all checks must pass
pnpm exec nx affected --target=analyze-code --configuration=check --base=main
```

For new/untracked files not yet picked up by `nx affected`:

```bash
pnpm exec nx run <project>:analyze-code --configuration=write
pnpm exec nx run <project>:analyze-code --configuration=check
```

**Do not commit until both commands pass cleanly.** If they fail, use the [triage-submission skill](.agents/skills/triage-submission/SKILL.md) to diagnose and fix the errors.

**TypeScript type coverage rule:** For any touched TypeScript project that defines a `type-coverage` target, run both `typecheck` and `type-coverage` before declaring implementation complete. Passing `typecheck` alone is not sufficient when `type-coverage` is available.

**Never silence errors with disable comments or configuration changes.** Do not use `// eslint-disable`, `// eslint-disable-next-line`, `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error`, `/* eslint-disable */`, `nocheck`, or similar suppression comments to work around lint or type errors. Do not loosen TypeScript `compilerOptions` (e.g. enabling `skipLibCheck`, disabling `strict` flags) or add ESLint `ignores`/`rules` overrides to suppress specific errors. Instead, triage the root cause and fix the code. Suppression is only permitted when the user explicitly requests it.

See the [validate-code skill](.agents/skills/validate-code/SKILL.md) for the full validation workflow and per-tool fix guidance.

## Key Conventions

### Abbreviations

- **No Acronyms or Abbreviations**: Never use acronyms or abbreviations for variable names, function names, parameters, etc.
- Use explicit and unabbreviated names (e.g. `request` instead of `req`, `response` instead of `res`, `index` instead of `i`, `error` instead of `e`).
- **Exceptions**: Abbreviations are acceptable when avoiding language reserved word collisions (e.g., using `args` instead of `arguments`, `str` instead of `string`).
- Abbreviation rules are enforced by ESLint (`unicorn/prevent-abbreviations`) and CSpell (`flagWords`).

### Project Tags

- **`language:typescript`** — applied to all TypeScript projects (caelundas, lexico, lexico-components, conformance, monorepo)
- **`language:python`** — applied to all Python projects (affirmations)

These tags enable conditional sub-target composition in composite targets (`format`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`). Python projects override the TS-default composite targets to compose Python sub-targets (`ruff-format`, `ruff-lint`, `pyright`, `pytest`) instead of TS ones.

See [Python Conventions](documentation/conventions/python.md) for the full Python tooling setup.

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode enabled**: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- **Explicit return types** required for all functions
- **Type imports**: Use `import { type Foo } from './types'` (enforced by ESLint)
- **File extensions in imports**: Always include `.js` extensions for relative imports (required by NodeNext resolution)
- **No `any` types**: Use `unknown` or proper typing
- **No non-null assertions**: Never use `!` — use optional chaining or explicit guards
- **Readonly class properties**: Mark all never-mutated class properties as `readonly`
- **Exhaustive switches**: All switch statements on union types must handle every member
- **Async functions**: All functions returning `Promise` must use the `async` keyword
- **No floating promises**: Every Promise must be awaited or explicitly `void`-annotated
- **Consistent returns**: All code paths must uniformly return or not return a value
- **Curly braces**: Always use `{}` for `if`/`else`/`for`/`while` — no single-line forms
- **Early returns**: Remove `else` after a `return` — use guard clauses
- **Object shorthand**: Use `{ name }` instead of `{ name: name }`
- **Template literals**: Use `` `Hello ${name}` `` instead of `"Hello " + name`
- **Max 3 function parameters**: Group extras into an options object (constructors: 12)
- **JSDoc on public APIs**: Public functions, classes, methods, interfaces, types, and enums must have JSDoc — only when it adds non-obvious context
- **Section comments**: Use `// 🎯 Section name` (emoji + capitalized name). Never use dash lines or ASCII art dividers. See [write-comment skill](.agents/skills/write-comment/SKILL.md).
- **NestJS class file shape**: In `*.service.ts`, `*.command.ts`, `*.resolver.ts`, `*.dataloader.ts`, and `*.module.ts`, keep only imports and the class at top level. Move helper types/interfaces to `*.types.ts`, constants to `*.constants.ts`, and never use alias or type re-exports from class files.

See [TypeScript Conventions](documentation/conventions/typescript.md) for strict mode patterns.

### Import Organization

Auto-sorted by ESLint: builtins → externals → `@monorepo/*` → relatives → type imports (blank lines between groups).

See [Import Organization](documentation/conventions/imports.md) for rules.

### Testing

- **Unit** (`*.unit.test.ts`): Pure functions, mocked I/O, fast (< 100ms)
- **Integration** (`*.integration.test.ts`): Database/API, real I/O, moderate (1-2s)
- **End-to-end** (`*.end-to-end.test.ts`): Full workflows, real services, slow (30-60s)

```bash
nx run <project>:test:unit        # Fast feedback
nx run <project>:test:integration # Database validation
nx affected --target=test         # Only changed projects
```

See [Testing Strategy](documentation/code-quality/testing-strategy.md) for patterns.

### Git Workflow

**Never bypass git hooks** with `--no-verify` — fix the underlying issue instead.

**Never suppress lint or type errors** with disable comments (`eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `nocheck`) or by loosening configuration — triage and fix the code instead. Suppression is only permitted when the user explicitly requests it.

#### Branch Names

Format: `<type>/<scope>-<description>` — all three parts required, kebab-case description.

Examples: `feat/lexico-user-auth`, `fix/caelundas-timezone-bug`, `docs/monorepo-architecture`

Special branches exempt from naming convention: `main`, `develop`, `renovate/*`, `dependabot/*`

#### Worktrees

- When asked to create a Git worktree, derive or reuse a branch name that follows `<type>/<scope>-<description>`.
- Validate the candidate branch first with `pnpm exec validate-branch-name -t "<branch-name>"`.
- Prefer `bash .agents/skills/create-worktree/scripts/create-worktree.sh "<branch-name>" [base-branch] [worktree-path]` over raw `git worktree add`.
- Default the worktree path to `../monorepo-worktrees/<branch-name-with-slashes-replaced-by-hyphens>` unless the user requests a different path.
- If the branch already exists locally, attach a worktree to it instead of creating a second branch.

#### Commit Messages

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <gitmoji> <subject>` — single line only, max 128 chars.

- **Gitmoji required** at the start of the subject line
- **Body and footer are forbidden** — all context goes in the subject or PR description
- Subject: lowercase, imperative mood, no period
- Never list multiple changes — summarize at a higher level or split into separate commits

Common gitmojis: ✨ `feat` · 🐛 `fix` · 📝 `docs` · 🧪 `test` · ♻️ `refactor` · 🎨 `style` · ⚡️ `perf` · 🔧 `chore` · 👷 `ci` · 📦 `build` · ⏪ `revert`

Examples:

```text
feat(lexico): ✨ add user profile page
fix(caelundas): 🐛 correct aspect angle calculation
chore(dependencies): ⬆️ upgrade react to v19
docs(monorepo): 📝 update contributing guide
```

#### Pull Requests

PR title follows the same format as commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <gitmoji> <subject>`

PR description template:

```markdown
## 🌰 Summary

<!-- Brief description of what this PR does (1-2 sentences) -->

## 📝 Details

- <!-- List of specific changes made -->

## 🧪 Testing

1. <!-- How to manually verify these changes work correctly -->

```

### React Patterns

- **React 19** with new JSX transform (no React import needed)
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing in lexico
- **shadcn/ui components** via lexico-components (never duplicate UI code)
- **Tailwind CSS** with CSS variables for theming

See [React Conventions](documentation/conventions/react.md) for component structure and patterns.

pnpm add -w <package>                  # Workspace root
```

### Running Tasks

```bash
nx run caelundas:develop               # Single project
nx run-many --target=lint --all        # All projects
nx affected --target=test --base=main  # Only changed
```

### Affirmations (Python + Ollama)

```bash
nx run affirmations:ollama           # Start Ollama container (default: start)
nx run affirmations:searxng          # Start SearxNG container (default: start)
nx run affirmations:open-webui       # Start Open WebUI container (default: start)
nx run affirmations:test             # Run all tests
nx run affirmations:test:unit        # Run unit tests
nx run affirmations:lint             # Ruff linting
nx run affirmations:typecheck        # pyright + ty type checking (parallel)
nx run affirmations:ty               # ty type checker (standalone)
nx run affirmations:bandit           # Security linting
nx run affirmations:vulture          # Detect unused code
nx run affirmations:open-webui --configuration=open  # Open Ollama chat UI
nx run affirmations:searxng --configuration=open     # Open SearxNG search UI
```

## Project Architecture

**Path mappings**: `@monorepo/*` namespace for shared packages (defined in [tsconfig.base.json](tsconfig.base.json))

**Dependency graph**: View with `nx graph` or use `nx_workspace` MCP tool

**Projects**:

- lexico depends on lexico-components
- caelundas is standalone
- Nx rebuilds dependents automatically

## Common Issues

| Issue                    | Solution                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Index access error       | Use optional chaining: `arr[0]?.prop`         |
| Docker platform mismatch | Build with `--platform linux/amd64`           |
| Commit rejected          | Follow format: `type(scope): gitmoji subject` |
| Branch name rejected     | Use pattern: `type/scope-description`         |

See [Common Gotchas](documentation/troubleshooting/gotchas.md) for detailed solutions.

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
