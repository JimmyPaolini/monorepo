# Refresh Documentation

This skill guides a systematic review and refresh of all documentation across the monorepo. It is also invoked automatically each week by the `refresh-documentation` GitHub Actions workflow, which creates a GitHub issue assigned to Copilot.

## When to Use This Skill

- When asked to "refresh documentation", "update docs", or "audit documentation"
- When documentation may be stale after significant code changes
- On the weekly scheduled cadence (triggered automatically via GitHub issue)

## Scope

Documentation to review and update:

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `README.md` | Root monorepo README |
| `documentation/**/*.md` | Core documentation files |
| `AGENTS.md` | Workspace-level Copilot instructions — skill table must stay in sync |
| `*/AGENTS.md` | Per-project Copilot instructions |
| `*/README.md` | Project README files |
| `.github/skills/**/SKILL.md` | Skill files (mirrored to `documentation/skills/`) |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1 — Audit

For each path in scope, read the documentation and cross-check it against the actual codebase. Classify every finding into one of three categories:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Deprecated** | Documents a feature, command, file, or API that no longer exists | **Remove** the section or file |
| **Outdated** | Content exists but is inaccurate — wrong path, outdated command, incorrect description | **Update** to match current reality |
| **Missing** | A feature, project, convention, or workflow exists in the codebase but is undocumented | **Create** new documentation |

### Phase 2 — Act

1. **Remove deprecated content** — Delete sections, files, or entries that document things that no longer exist. This includes dead links, removed commands, retired projects, and superseded conventions.

2. **Update outdated content** — Fix inaccurate content by cross-checking against actual source files:
   - Code examples: verify commands, file paths, and APIs against the codebase
   - README files: check that project structure, commands, and purpose are accurate
   - AGENTS.md files: verify quick-reference commands still work and descriptions match current conventions
   - Cross-references: fix broken internal links

3. **Create missing documentation** — Write new content for undocumented areas:
   - New projects added since the last documentation refresh
   - New conventions, tools, or workflows not yet documented
   - Features documented in code comments but absent from markdown docs

### Phase 3 — Submit

If any changes were made, use the `submit-changes` skill to create a branch, commit, and open a PR with a `docs(documentation): 📝` commit message.
